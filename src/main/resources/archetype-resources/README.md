##README
This repository is a skeleton of java web project organized by Rugal Bernstein.  
Integreted Spring-webmvc, Spring-framework and mybatis, so I will call it as SSM for short.  
This skeleton use HikariCP as data source.  
Deployment descriptor version is already 3.0, so it could support most of new features on Oracle JVM.  
All maven dependencies are reduced to simplest, no need of worrying about the dependency redundent.  
Use Tomcat as default servlet container.  
Use spring-framework's jdbc DataSourceTransactionManager as Transaction Manage, with some default transaction advices given.  
Use slf4j as log adapter and logger in Log4j. You can change it as you want.  
This project's controller return JSON as default response body, customize it in springmvc configuration file if you need to change.  
Provided base test file and template test file from both server side integretion test and unit test.  

### Usage
Just clone this Repository to your FS, and do some changes in pom.xml to make sure your project name and deployment path are set correctly!  
Then dive into src/main/resource folder to do your configuration, all configuration files are put in this folder:  

1. JDBC properties  already rather generic  
2. applicationContext  defines mybatis and data source properties. You NEED to do some change in this file as some package scan bean need directed.  
3. springmvc  Just one place needs change: base-package of component-scan tag  
4. log4j  already rather generic
